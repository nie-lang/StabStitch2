#### ATTENTION
When you want to train the warp smoothing model, you should generate the spatial and temporal warps first, as described in SpatialWarp/README.md and TemporalWarp/README.md.

#### Train on the StabStitch-D dataset
Modify the train_path in train_ssd.py and run:
```
python train_ssd.py
```
#### Train on TraditionalDataset
Modify the train_path in train_tra.py and run:
```
python train_tra.py
```
